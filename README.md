## Project Structure

### Objectives

The main goals of the project are:

- To clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality.
- To perform **descriptive mining** by identifying associations and clustering patterns within the dataset.
- To conduct **predictive mining** using methods such as decision trees, regression models, and neural networks.
- To evaluate the results and provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

### Key Components

The project will cover the following:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
   - Handling missing values and duplicates  
   - Converting data types  
   - Ensuring dataset readiness for analysis  

2. **Descriptive Mining**  
   - Association analysis to uncover relationships between items  
   - Clustering to identify natural groupings in the data  

3. **Predictive Mining**  
   - Building and evaluating decision tree models  
   - Creating regression models to predict outcomes  
   - Implementing neural networks for advanced predictions  

4. **Evaluation and Recommendations**  
   - Comparing models based on metrics such as accuracy and ROC curves  
   - Summarizing key findings  
   - Providing recommendations supported by analysis
